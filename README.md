# cats-vs-dogs-classifier
The primary aim of this project is to develop a machine learning-based classifier capable of discerning between images of cats and dogs. The classifier should be robust enough to correctly categorize these images, despite variations in pose, thereby providing a solution for a binary classification problem.
